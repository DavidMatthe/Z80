Z80 v0.2 (2022-XX-XX)
=====================

This is an important update that addresses a number of issues and also includes
new features. Please note that the changes introduced in this release break the
binary compatibility with the previous version.

Changes:
 1. Changed the license from GPL to LGPL (by popular request).
 2. Moved the public header from <emulation/CPU/Z80.h> to <Z80.h>.
 3. Removed the Xcode project.
 4. Switched the build system from Premake to CMake.
 5. Switched to Zeta v0.1.
 6. Added pkg-config support.
 7. Added the .vimrc dotfile.
 8. Added the CITATION.cff file.
 9. Added the file_id.diz file.
10. Added the THANKS file.
11. Added detailed documentation.
12. Added tests.
13. Added public macros for checking the library version.
14. Added public macros with bit masks for working with flags.
15. Added public macros for accessing the 16-bit registers.
16. Added the `z80_execute` function for running a simplified emulation without
    RESET and interrupts.
17. Added the `z80_refresh_address` function for getting the refresh address of
    the current M1 cycle.
18. Added the `z80_in_cycle` and `z80_out_cycle` functions for obtaining the
    clock cycle at which the I/O M-cycle begins, relative to the start of the
    instruction.
19. Fixed a bug in the `sll` instruction.
20. Fixed a bug in the `INX` and `OUTX` macros affecting the S and N flags.
21. Fixed a bug in the `OUTX` macro affecting the MSByte of the port number.
22. Fixed the clock cycles of the `dec XY` and `in (c)` instructions.
23. Fixed the `read_16` function so that the order of the memory read operations
    is not determined by the order in which the compiler evaluates expressions.
24. Fixed the order in which the memory write operations are performed when the
    SP register is involved. This affects the NMI response, the INT response in
    modes 1 and 2, and the following instructions: `ex (sp),{hl|XY}`, `push TT`,
    `push XY`, `call WORD`, `call Z,WORD` and `rst N`.
25. Fixed the handling of illegal instructions to avoid stack overflows in long
    sequences of DDh/FDh prefixes.
26. Fixed several implicit conversions to avoid warnings about loss of sign and
    precision.
27. Fixed some bitwise operations to avoid undefined behavior and arithmetic
    right shifts on signed integers.
28. Fixed violations of the C standard in several identifiers.
29. Renamed the 8-bit register lists: X/Y to J/K; J/K and P/Q to O/P.
30. Replaced all P/V overflow computation functions with a single, faster macro.
31. Replaced all register resolution functions with macros.
32. Replaced all `ld {J,K|O,P}` instructions that have the same destination and
    source register with NOPs. In addition, the "illegal" forms of the `ld O,P`,
    `ld O,BYTE`, `U [a,]P` and `V O` instructions are now executed without using
    the illegal instruction handler.
33. Reimplemented the HALT state. The emulation should now be fully accurate.
    HALTskip is also supported.
34. Renamed the `z80_reset` function to `z80_instant_reset`.
35. Added optional emulation of the special RESET, along with the new
    `z80_special_reset` function.
36. Added the `Z80::fetch_opcode` and `Z80::fetch` callbacks for performing
    opcode fetch operations and memory read operations on instruction data
    respectively.
37. Added the `Z80::nop` callback for performing disregarded opcode fetch
    operations during internal NOP M-cycles.
38. Added emulation of the NMI acknowledge M-cycle through the new `Z80::nmia`
    callback.
39. Added emulation of the INT acknowledge M-cycle through the new `Z80::inta`
    callback, which replaces `Z80::int_data`.
40. Added optional full emulation of the interrupt mode 0, along with the new
    `Z80::int_fetch` callback for performing bus read operations on instruction
    data. If not enabled at compile-time, the old simplified emulation is built,
    which supports only the most typical instructions.
41. Added four callbacks for notifying the execution of important instructions:
    `Z80::ld_i_a`, `Z80::ld_r_a`, `Z80::reti` and `Z80::retn`.
42. Added hooking functionality through the `ld h,h` instruction and the new
    `Z80::hook` callback.
43. Added the `Z80::illegal` callback for delegating the emulation of illegal
    instructions.
44. Added accurate flag behavior in the following instructions: `ldir`, `lddr`,
    `cpir`, `cpdr`, `inir`, `indr`, `otir` and `otdr`.
45. Added emulation of the interrupt acceptance deferral that occurs during the
    `reti` and `retn` instructions.
46. Added MEMPTR emulation. The `bit N,(hl)` instruction now produces a correct
    value of F.
47. Added optional emulation of the Q "register". If enabled at compile-time,
    the `ccf` and `scf` instructions produce a correct value of F.
48. Added emulation options that can be configured at runtime.
49. Added emulation of the `out (c),255` instruction (Zilog Z80 CMOS).
50. Added optional emulation of the bug affecting the `ld a,{i|r}` instructions
    (Zilog Z80 NMOS). If enabled at compile-time, the P/V flag is reset when an
    INT is accepted during the execution of these instructions.
51. Removed `Z80::state`. Replaced with individual members for the registers,
    the interrupt enable flip-flops and the interrupt mode.
52. Removed the superfluous EI flag. The previous opcode is checked instead,
    which is faster and makes the `Z80` object smaller.
53. Removed all module-related stuff.
54. Optimizations in flag computation and condition evaluation.
55. New source code comments and improvements to existing ones.
56. Improved code aesthetics.
57. Other improvements, optimizations and minor changes.
